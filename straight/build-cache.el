property list containing e.g. `:type', `:local-repo', `:files',
and VC backend specific keywords.

First, the package recipe is registered with straight.el. If
NO-CLONE is a function, then it is called with two arguments: the
package name as a string, and a boolean value indicating whether
the local repository for the package is available. In that case,
the return value of the function is used as the value of NO-CLONE
instead. In any case, if NO-CLONE is non-nil, then processing
stops here.

Otherwise, the repository is cloned, if it is missing. If
NO-BUILD is a function, then it is called with one argument: the
package name as a string. In that case, the return value of the
function is used as the value of NO-BUILD instead. In any case,
if NO-BUILD is non-nil, then processing halts here. Otherwise,
the package is built and activated. Note that if the package
recipe has a nil `:build' entry, then NO-BUILD is ignored
and processing always stops before building and activation
occurs.

CAUSE is a string explaining the reason why
`straight-use-package' has been called. It is for internal use
only, and is used to construct progress messages. INTERACTIVE is
non-nil if the function has been called interactively. It is for
internal use only, and is used to determine whether to show a
hint about how to install the package permanently.

** Keywords

Keywords supported:

- :sources
- :input
- :prompt
- :resume
- :preselect
- :buffer
- :keymap
- :default
- :history
- :allow-nest

Extra LOCAL-VARS keywords are supported, see the \"** Other
keywords\" section below.

Basic keywords are the following:

*** :sources

One of the following:

- List of sources
- Symbol whose value is a list of sources
- Alist representing a Helm source.
  - In this case the source has no name and is referenced in
    `helm-sources' as a whole alist.

*** :input

Initial input of minibuffer (temporary value of `helm-pattern')

*** :prompt

Minibuffer prompt. Default value is `helm--prompt'.

*** :resume

If t, allow resumption of the previous session of this Helm
command, skipping initialization.

If 'noresume, this instance of `helm' cannot be resumed.

*** :preselect

Initially selected candidate (string or regexp).

*** :buffer

Buffer name for this Helm session. `helm-buffer' will take this value.

*** :keymap

[Obsolete]

Keymap used at the start of this Helm session.

It is overridden by keymaps specified in sources, and is kept
only for backward compatibility.

Keymaps should be specified in sources using the :keymap slot
instead. See `helm-source'.

This keymap is not restored by `helm-resume'.

*** :default

Default value inserted into the minibuffer with
\\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element].

It can be a string or a list of strings, in this case
\\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element] cycles through
the list items, starting with the first.

If nil, `thing-at-point' is used.

If `helm-maybe-use-default-as-input' is non-nil, display is
updated using this value if this value matches, otherwise it is
ignored. If :input is specified, it takes precedence on :default.

*** :history

Minibuffer input, by default, is pushed to `minibuffer-history'.

When an argument HISTORY is provided, input is pushed to
HISTORY. HISTORY should be a valid symbol.

*** :allow-nest

Allow running this Helm command in a running Helm session.

** Other keywords

Other keywords are interpreted as local variables of this Helm
session. The `helm-' prefix can be omitted. For example,

(helm :sources 'helm-source-buffers-list
       :buffer \"*helm buffers*\"
       :candidate-number-limit 10)

Starts a Helm session with the variable
`helm-candidate-number-limit' set to 10.

** Backward compatibility

For backward compatibility, positional parameters are
supported:

(helm sources input prompt resume preselect
       buffer keymap default history allow-nest)

However, the use of non-keyword args is deprecated.

- PROMPT is the prompt name to use.

- COLLECTION can be a list, alist, vector, obarray or hash-table.
  For alists and hash-tables their car are use as real value of
  candidate unless ALISTP is non-nil.
  It can be also a function that receives three arguments:
  the values string, predicate and t. See `all-completions' for more details.

Keys description:

- TEST: A predicate called with one arg i.e candidate.

- INITIAL-INPUT: Same as input arg in `helm'.

- PRESELECT: See preselect arg of `helm'.

- DEFAULT: This option is used only for compatibility with regular
  Emacs `completing-read' (Same as DEFAULT arg of `completing-read').

- BUFFER: Name of helm-buffer.

- MUST-MATCH: Candidate selected must be one of COLLECTION.

- FUZZY: Enable fuzzy matching.

- REVERSE-HISTORY: When non--nil display history source after current
  source completion.

- REQUIRES-PATTERN: Same as helm attribute, default is 0.

- HISTORY: A symbol where each result will be saved.
  If not specified as a symbol an error will popup.
  When specified, all elements of HISTORY are displayed in
  a special source before or after COLLECTION according to REVERSE-HISTORY.
  The main difference with INPUT-HISTORY is that the result of the
  completion is saved whereas in INPUT-HISTORY it is the minibuffer
  contents which is saved when you exit.
  Don't use the same symbol for INPUT-HISTORY and HISTORY.
  NOTE: As mentionned above this has nothing to do with
  `minibuffer-history-variable', therefore if you want to save this
  history persistently, you will have to add this variable to the
  relevant variable of your favorite tool for persistent emacs session
  i.e. psession, desktop etc...

- RAW-HISTORY: When non-nil do not remove backslashs if some in
  HISTORY candidates.

- INPUT-HISTORY: A symbol. The minibuffer input history will be
  stored there, if nil or not provided, `minibuffer-history'
  will be used instead.  You can navigate in this history with
  `M-p' and `M-n'.
  Don't use the same symbol for INPUT-HISTORY and HISTORY.

- CASE-FOLD: Same as `helm-case-fold-search'.

- PERSISTENT-ACTION: A function called with one arg i.e candidate.

- PERSISTENT-HELP: A string to document PERSISTENT-ACTION.

- MODE-LINE: A string or list to display in mode line.
  Default is `helm-comp-read-mode-line'.

- KEYMAP: A keymap to use in this `helm-comp-read'.
  (the keymap will be shared with history source)

- NAME: The name related to this local source.

- HEADER-NAME: A function to alter NAME, see `helm'.

- EXEC-WHEN-ONLY-ONE: Bound `helm-execute-action-at-once-if-one'
  to non--nil. (possibles values are t or nil).

- VOLATILE: Use volatile attribute.

- SORT: A predicate to give to `sort' e.g `string-lessp'
  Use this only on small data as it is inefficient.
  If you want to sort faster add a sort function to
  FC-TRANSFORMER.
  Note that FUZZY when enabled is already providing a sort function.

- FC-TRANSFORMER: A `filtered-candidate-transformer' function
  or a list of functions.

- HIST-FC-TRANSFORMER: A `filtered-candidate-transformer'
  function for the history source.

- MARKED-CANDIDATES: If non-nil return candidate or marked candidates as a list.

- NOMARK: When non--nil don't allow marking candidates.

- ALISTP:
  When non-nil (default) pass the value of (DISPLAY . REAL)
  candidate in COLLECTION to action when COLLECTION is an alist or a
  hash-table, otherwise DISPLAY is always returned as result on exit,
  which is the default when using `completing-read'.
  See `helm-comp-read-get-candidates'.

- CANDIDATES-IN-BUFFER: when non--nil use a source build with
  `helm-source-in-buffer' which is much faster.
  Argument VOLATILE have no effect when CANDIDATES-IN-BUFFER is non--nil.

- MATCH-PART: Allow matching only one part of candidate.
  See match-part documentation in `helm-source'.

- MATCH-DYNAMIC: See match-dynamic in `helm-source-sync'
  It has no effect when used with CANDIDATES-IN-BUFFER.

- ALLOW-NEST: Allow nesting this `helm-comp-read' in a helm session.
  See `helm'.

- MULTILINE: See multiline in `helm-source'.

- COERCE: See coerce in `helm-source'.

- GROUP: See group in `helm-source'.

Any prefix args passed during `helm-comp-read' invocation will be recorded
in `helm-current-prefix-arg', otherwise if prefix args were given before
`helm-comp-read' invocation, the value of `current-prefix-arg' will be used.
That means you can pass prefix args before or after calling a command
that use `helm-comp-read'.  See `helm-M-x' for example.

Either way, the return value is a function which can be called
anywhere to stop this spinner.  You can also call `spinner-stop'
in the same buffer where the spinner was created.

FPS, if given, is the number of desired frames per second.
Default is `spinner-frames-per-second'.

DELAY, if given, is the number of seconds to wait until actually
displaying the spinner. It is safe to cancel the spinner before
this time, in which case it won't display at all.

POSITION can be:

2. A cons of two integers, meaning absolute X and Y coordinates.
3. Other type, in which case the corresponding POSHANDLER should be
   provided.

 (2) POSHANDLER

POSHANDLER is a function of one argument returning an actual
position.  Its argument is a plist of the following form:

  (:position xxx
   :poshandler xxx
   :font-height xxx
   :font-width xxx
   :posframe xxx
   :posframe-width xxx
   :posframe-height xxx
   :posframe-buffer xxx
   :parent-frame xxx

   :parent-window-width  xxx
   :parent-window-height xxx
   :mouse-x xxx
   ;mouse-y xxx
   :minibuffer-height xxx
   :mode-line-height  xxx
   :header-line-height xxx
   :tab-line-height xxx
   :x-pixel-offset xxx
   :y-pixel-offset xxx)

By default, poshandler is auto-selected based on the type of POSITION,
but the selection can be overridden using the POSHANDLER argument.

The names of poshandler functions are like:

   `posframe-poshandler-p0.5p0-to-w0.5p1'

which mean align posframe(0.5, 0) to a position(a, b)

1. a = x of window(0.5, 0)
2. b = y of point(1, 1)

    posframe(p), frame(f), window(w), point(p), mouse(m)

by the way, poshandler can be used by other packages easily with
the help of function `posframe-poshandler-argbuilder'.  like:

   (let* ((info (posframe-poshandler-argbuilder *MY-CHILD-FRAME*))
          (posn (posframe-poshandler-window-center
                 `(:posframe-width 800 :posframe-height 400 ,@info))))
     `((left . ,(car posn))
       (top . ,(cdr posn))))

 (3) POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO

POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO is a plist, which will prepend to the
argument of poshandler function: `info', it will *OVERRIDE* the
exist key in `info'.

 (4) BUFFER-OR-NAME

This posframe's buffer is BUFFER-OR-NAME, which can be a buffer
or a name of a (possibly nonexistent) buffer.

buffer name can prefix with space, for example \" *mybuffer*\", so
the buffer name will hide for ibuffer and `list-buffers'.

 (5) NO-PROPERTIES

If NO-PROPERTIES is non-nil, The STRING's properties will
be removed before being shown in posframe.

 (6) HEIGHT, MAX-HEIGHT, MIN-HEIGHT, WIDTH, MAX-WIDTH and MIN-WIDTH

These arguments are specified in the canonical character width
and height of posframe, more details can be found in docstring of
function `fit-frame-to-buffer',

 (7) LEFT-FRINGE and RIGHT-FRINGE

If LEFT-FRINGE or RIGHT-FRINGE is a number, left fringe or
right fringe with be shown with the specified width.

 (8) BORDER-WIDTH, BORDER-COLOR, INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR

By default, posframe shows no borders, but users can specify
borders by setting BORDER-WIDTH to a positive number.  Border
color can be specified by BORDER-COLOR.

INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR are same as
BORDER-WIDTH and BORDER-COLOR, but do not suggest to use for the
reason:

   Add distinct controls for child frames' borders (Bug#45620)
   http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=ff7b1a133bfa7f2614650f8551824ffaef13fadc

 (9) FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR

Posframe's font as well as foreground and background colors are
derived from the current frame by default, but can be overridden
using the FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR arguments,
respectively.

 (10) RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE

By default, posframe will display no header-line, mode-line and
tab-line.  In case a header-line, mode-line or tab-line is
desired, users can set RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE
to t.

 (11) INITIALIZE

INITIALIZE is a function with no argument.  It will run when
posframe buffer is first selected with `with-current-buffer'
in `posframe-show', and only run once (for performance reasons).

 (12) LINES-TRUNCATE

If LINES-TRUNCATE is non-nil, then lines will truncate in the
posframe instead of wrap.

 (13) OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS

OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS is very powful, *all* the valid frame parameters
used by posframe's frame can be overridden by it.

NOTE: some `posframe-show' arguments are not frame parameters, so they
can not be overrided by this argument.

 (14) TIMEOUT

TIMEOUT can specify the number of seconds after which the posframe
will auto-hide.

 (15) REFRESH

If REFRESH is a number, posframe's frame-size will be re-adjusted
every REFRESH seconds.

 (16) ACCEPT-FOCUS

When ACCEPT-FOCUS is non-nil, posframe will accept focus.
be careful, you may face some bugs when set it to non-nil.

 (17) HIDEHANDLER

HIDEHANDLER is a function, when it return t, posframe will be
hide, this function has a plist argument:

  (:posframe-buffer xxx
   :posframe-parent-buffer xxx)

The builtin hidehandler functions are listed below:

1. `posframe-hidehandler-when-buffer-switch'

 (18) REFPOSHANDLER

REFPOSHANDLER is a function, a reference position (most is
top-left of current frame) will be returned when call this
function.

when it is nil or it return nil, child-frame feature will be used
and reference position will be deal with in Emacs.

The user case I know at the moment is let ivy-posframe work well
in EXWM environment (let posframe show on the other appliction
window).

         DO NOT USE UNLESS NECESSARY!!!

An example parent frame poshandler function is:

1. `posframe-refposhandler-xwininfo'

 (19) Others

You can use `posframe-delete-all' to delete all posframes.

Define MAPS, optionally using DEFINER, in the keymap(s) corresponding to STATES
and KEYMAPS.

MAPS consists of paired keys (vectors or strings; also see
`general-implicit-kbd') and definitions (those mentioned in `define-key''s
docstring and general.el's \"extended\" definitions). All pairs (when not
ignored) will be recorded and can be later displayed with
`general-describe-keybindings'.

If DEFINER is specified, a custom key definer will be used to bind MAPS. See
general.el's documentation/README for more information.

Unlike with normal key definitions functions, the keymaps in KEYMAPS should be
quoted (this allows using the keymap name for other purposes, e.g. deferring
keybindings if the keymap symbol is not bound, optionally inferring the
corresponding major mode for a symbol by removing \"-map\" for :which-key,
easily storing the keymap name for use with `general-describe-keybindings',
etc.). Note that general.el provides other key definer macros that do not
require quoting keymaps.

STATES corresponds to the evil state(s) to bind the keys in. Non-evil users
should not set STATES. When STATES is non-nil, `evil-define-key*' will be
used (the evil auxiliary keymaps corresponding STATES and KEYMAPS will be used);
otherwise `define-key' will be used (unless DEFINER is specified). KEYMAPS
defaults to 'global. There is also 'local, which create buffer-local
keybindings for both evil and non-evil keybindings. There are other special,
user-alterable \"shorthand\" symbols for keymaps and states (see
`general-keymap-aliases' and `general-state-aliases').

Note that STATES and KEYMAPS can either be lists or single symbols. If any
keymap does not exist, those keybindings will be deferred until the keymap does
exist, so using `eval-after-load' is not necessary with this function.

PREFIX corresponds to a key to prefix keys in MAPS with and defaults to none. To
bind/unbind a key specified with PREFIX, \"\" can be specified as a key in
MAPS (e.g. ...:prefix \"SPC\" \"\" nil... will unbind space).

The keywords in this paragraph are only useful for evil users. If
NON-NORMAL-PREFIX is specified, this prefix will be used instead of PREFIX for
states in `general-non-normal-states' (e.g. the emacs and insert states). This
argument will only have an effect if one of these states is in STATES or if
corresponding global keymap (e.g. `evil-insert-state-map') is in KEYMAPS.
Alternatively, GLOBAL-PREFIX can be used with PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX to
bind keys in all states under the specified prefix. Like with NON-NORMAL-PREFIX,
GLOBAL-PREFIX will prevent PREFIX from applying to `general-non-normal-states'.
INFIX can be used to append a string to all of the specified prefixes. This is
potentially useful when you are using GLOBAL-PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX so
that you can sandwich keys in between all the prefixes and the specified keys in
MAPS. This may be particularly useful if you are using default prefixes in a
wrapper function/macro so that you can add to them without needing to re-specify
all of them. If none of the other prefix keyword arguments are specified, INFIX
will have no effect.

If PREFIX-COMMAND or PREFIX-MAP is specified, a prefix command and/or keymap
will be created. PREFIX-NAME can be additionally specified to set the keymap
menu name/prompt. If PREFIX-COMMAND is specified, `define-prefix-command' will
be used. Otherwise, only a prefix keymap will be created. Previously created
prefix commands/keymaps will never be redefined/cleared. All prefixes (including
the INFIX key, if specified) will then be bound to PREFIX-COMMAND or PREFIX-MAP.
If the user did not specify any PREFIX or manually specify any KEYMAPS, general
will bind all MAPS in the prefix keymap corresponding to either PREFIX-MAP or
PREFIX-COMMAND instead of in the default keymap.

PREDICATE corresponds to a predicate to check to determine whether a definition
should be active (e.g. \":predicate '(eobp)\"). Definitions created with a
predicate will only be active when the predicate is true. When the predicate is
false, key lookup will continue to search for a match in lower-precedence
keymaps.

In addition to the normal definitions supported by `define-key', general.el also
provides \"extended\" definitions, which are plists containing the normal
definition as well as other keywords. For example, PREDICATE can be specified
globally or locally in an extended definition. New global (~general-define-key~)
and local (extended definition) keywords can be added by the user. See
`general-extended-def-keywords' and general.el's documentation/README for more
information.

PACKAGE is the global version of the extended definition keyword that specifies
the package a keymap is defined in (used for \"autoloading\" keymaps)

PROPERTIES, REPEAT, and JUMP are the global versions of the extended definition
keywords used for adding evil command properties to commands.

MAJOR-MODES, WK-MATCH-KEYS, WK-MATCH-BINDINGS, and WK-FULL-KEYS are the
corresponding global versions of which-key extended definition keywords. They
will only have an effect for extended definitions that specify :which-key or
:wk. See the section on extended definitions in the general.el
documentation/README for more information.

LISPY-PLIST and WORF-PLIST are the global versions of extended definition
keywords that are used for each corresponding custom DEFINER.

simulating a prefix key/incomplete key sequence.

KEYS should be a string given in `kbd' notation. It can also be a list of a

Normally the generated function will look up KEY in the correct context to try

Generally, you will want to keep LOOKUP non-nil because this will allow checking
the evil repeat property of matched commands to determine whether or not they
should be recorded. See the docstring for `general--simulate-keys' for more

When a WHICH-KEY description is specified, it will replace the command name in
the which-key popup.

When a command name is specified and that command has been remapped (i.e. [remap
command] is currently bound), the remapped version will be used instead of the
original command unless REMAP is specified as nil (it is true by default).

The advantages of this over a keyboard macro are as follows:
- Prefix arguments are supported
- The user can control the context in which the keys are simulated
- The user can simulate both a named command and keys
- The user can simulate an incomplete key sequence (e.g. for a keymap)

MAPS consists of <key> <command> pairs. If a key in MAPS is matched, the
corresponding command will be run. Otherwise FALLBACK-COMMAND will be run with
the unmatched keys. So, for example, if \"ab\" was pressed, and \"ab\" is not
one of the key sequences from MAPS, the FALLBACK-COMMAND will be run followed by
the simulated keypresses of \"ab\". Prefix arguments will still work regardless
of which command is run. This is useful for binding under non-prefix keys. For
example, this can be used to redefine a sequence like \"cw\" or \"cow\" in evil
but still have \"c\" work as `evil-change'. If TIMEOUT is specified,
FALLBACK-COMMAND will also be run in the case that the user does not press the
next key within the TIMEOUT (e.g. 0.5).

NAME and DOCSTRING are optional keyword arguments. They can be used to replace
the automatically generated name and docstring for the created function. By
default, `cl-gensym' is used to prevent name clashes (e.g. allows the user to
create multiple different commands using `self-insert-command' as the
FALLBACK-COMMAND without explicitly specifying NAME to manually prevent
clashes).

When INHERIT-KEYMAP is specified, all the keybindings from that keymap will be

easy.  Complete documentation is available online at URL
`https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/'.  Please report issues and

The following PROPERTIES constitute an error level:

     A number denoting the severity of this level.  The higher

     levels.  Defaults to 0; info is -10, warning is 10, and
     error is 100.

     The severity is used by `flycheck-error-level-<' to
     determine the ordering of errors according to their levels.

`:compilation-level LEVEL'

     A number indicating the broad class of messages that errors
     at this level belong to: one of 0 (info), 1 (warning), or
     2 or nil (error).  Defaults to nil.

     This is used by `flycheck-checker-pattern-to-error-regexp'
     to map error levels into `compilation-mode''s hierarchy and
     to get proper highlighting of errors in `compilation-mode'.

`:overlay-category CATEGORY'
     A symbol denoting the overlay category to use for error
     highlight overlays for this level.  See Info
     node `(elisp)Overlay Properties' for more information about
     overlay categories.

     A category for an error level overlay should at least define
     the `face' property, for error highlighting.  Another useful
     property for error level categories is `priority', to
     influence the stacking of multiple error level overlays.

`:fringe-bitmap BITMAPS'
     A fringe bitmap symbol denoting the bitmap to use for fringe
     indicators for this level, or a cons of two bitmaps (one for
     narrow fringes and one for wide fringes).  See Info node
     `(elisp)Fringe Bitmaps' for more information about fringe
     bitmaps, including a list of built-in fringe bitmaps.

`:fringe-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for fringe indicators
     for this level.

`:margin-spec SPEC'
     A display specification indicating what to display in the
     margin when `flycheck-indication-mode' is `left-margin' or
     `right-margin'.  See Info node `(elisp)Displaying in the
     Margins'.  If omitted, Flycheck generates an image spec from
     the fringe bitmap.

In addition to the properties understood by
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', the following PROPERTIES
constitute a command syntax checker.  Unless otherwise noted, all
properties are mandatory.  Note that the default `:error-filter'
of command checkers is `flycheck-sanitize-errors'.

`:command COMMAND'
     The command to run for syntax checking.

     COMMAND is a list of the form `(EXECUTABLE [ARG ...])'.

     EXECUTABLE is a string with the executable of this syntax
     checker.  It can be overridden with the variable
     `flycheck-SYMBOL-executable'.  Note that this variable is
     NOT implicitly defined by this function.  Use
     `flycheck-def-executable-var' to define this variable.

     Each ARG is an argument to the executable, either as string,
     or as special symbol or form for
     `flycheck-substitute-argument', which see.

`:error-patterns PATTERNS'
     A list of patterns to parse the output of the `:command'.

     Each ITEM in PATTERNS is a list `(LEVEL SEXP ...)', where
     LEVEL is a Flycheck error level (see
     `flycheck-define-error-level'), followed by one or more RX
     `SEXP's which parse an error of that level and extract line,
     column, file name and the message.

     See `rx' for general information about RX, and
     `flycheck-rx-to-string' for some special RX forms provided
     by Flycheck.

     All patterns are applied in the order of declaration to the
     whole output of the syntax checker.  Output already matched
     by a pattern will not be matched by subsequent patterns.  In
     other words, the first pattern wins.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, however, an
     `:error-parser' is mandatory.

`:error-parser FUNCTION'
     A function to parse errors with.

     The function shall accept three arguments OUTPUT CHECKER
     BUFFER.  OUTPUT is the syntax checker output as string,
     CHECKER the syntax checker that was used, and BUFFER a
     buffer object representing the checked buffer.  The function
     must return a list of `flycheck-error' objects parsed from
     OUTPUT.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, it defaults to
     `flycheck-parse-with-patterns'.  In this case,
     `:error-patterns' is mandatory.

`:standard-input t'
     Whether to send the buffer contents on standard input.

     If this property is given and has a non-nil value, send the
     contents of the buffer on standard input.

     Defaults to nil.

Note that you may not give `:start', `:interrupt', and

other bindings.

Adding the above bindings is delayed until `after-init-hook'

that would cause Magit to be loaded immediately when that form

the key bindings have already been added.

We recommend that you bind \"C-c g\" instead of \"C-c M-g\" to

BODY has the format:

    (BODY-MAP BODY-KEY &rest BODY-PLIST)

DOCSTRING will be displayed in the echo area to identify the
Hydra.  When DOCSTRING starts with a newline, special Ruby-style
substitution will be performed by `hydra--format'.

Functions are created on basis of HEADS, each of which has the
format:

    (KEY CMD &optional HINT &rest PLIST)

BODY-MAP is a keymap; `global-map' is used quite often.  Each
function generated from HEADS will be bound in BODY-MAP to
BODY-KEY + KEY (both are strings passed to `kbd'), and will set
the transient map so that all following heads can be called
though KEY only.  BODY-KEY can be an empty string.

CMD is a callable expression: either an interactive function
name, or an interactive lambda, or a single sexp (it will be
wrapped in an interactive lambda).

HINT is a short string that identifies its head.  It will be
printed beside KEY in the echo erea if `hydra-is-helpful' is not
nil.  If you don't even want the KEY to be printed, set HINT
explicitly to nil.

The heads inherit their PLIST from BODY-PLIST and are allowed to
override some keys.  The keys recognized are :exit, :bind, and :column.
:exit can be:

- nil (default): this head will continue the Hydra state.
- t: this head will stop the Hydra state.

:bind can be:
- nil: this head will not be bound in BODY-MAP.
- a lambda taking KEY and CMD used to bind a head.

:column is a string that sets the column for all subsequent heads.

It is possible to omit both BODY-MAP and BODY-KEY if you don't
want to bind anything.  In that case, typically you will bind the
generated NAME/body command.  This command is also the return
result of `defhydra'.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the

the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when

This acts as more fine-grained alternative to `treemacs-follow-mode' and will
thus disable `treemacs-follow-mode' on activation.  When enabled treemacs will
focus not only the file of the current buffer, but also the tag at point.

The follow action is attached to Emacs' idle timer and will run
`treemacs-tag-follow-delay' seconds of idle time.  The delay value is not an
integer, meaning it accepts floating point values like 1.5.

Every time a tag is followed a re--scan of the imenu index is forced by
temporarily setting `imenu-auto-rescan' to t (though a cache is applied as long
as the buffer is unmodified).  This is necessary to assure that creation or
deletion of tags does not lead to errors and guarantees an always up-to-date tag
view.

Note that in order to move to a tag in treemacs the treemacs buffer's window
needs to be temporarily selected, which will reset blink-cursor-mode's timer if
it is enabled.  This will result in the cursor blinking seemingly pausing for a
short time and giving the appearance of the tag follow action lasting much
longer than it really does.

HISTORY is a name of a variable to hold the completion session
history.

KEYMAP is composed with `ivy-minibuffer-map'.

PRESELECT, when non-nil, determines which one of the candidates
matching INITIAL-INPUT to select initially.  An integer stands
for the position of the desired candidate in the collection,
counting from zero.  Otherwise, use the first occurrence of
PRESELECT in the collection.  Comparison is first done with
`equal'.  If that fails, and when applicable, match PRESELECT as
a regular expression.

DEF is for compatibility with `completing-read'.

UPDATE-FN is called each time the candidate list is re-displayed.

When SORT is non-nil, `ivy-sort-functions-alist' determines how
to sort candidates before displaying them.

ACTION is a function to call after selecting a candidate.
It takes one argument, the selected candidate. If COLLECTION is
an alist, the argument is a cons cell, otherwise it's a string.

MULTI-ACTION, when non-nil, is called instead of ACTION when
there are marked candidates. It takes the list of candidates as
its only argument. When it's nil, ACTION is called on each marked
candidate.

UNWIND is a function of no arguments to call before exiting.

RE-BUILDER is a function transforming input text into a regex
pattern.

MATCHER is a function which can override how candidates are
filtered based on user input.  It takes a regex pattern and a
list of candidates, and returns the list of matching candidates.

DYNAMIC-COLLECTION is a boolean specifying whether the list of
candidates is updated after each input by calling COLLECTION.

EXTRA-PROPS is a plist that can be used to store
collection-specific session-specific data.

CALLER is a symbol to uniquely identify the caller to `ivy-read'.
It is used, along with COLLECTION, to determine which
customizations apply to the current completion session.
